  <h3><a href="beef.html">Beef Stroganoff</a></h3>
  <p>
    A deliciously rich and creamy beef stroganoff that's easy to prep in 
    a slow cooker with little-to-no fuss. It smells wonderful and is 
    tasty like no other stroganoff you've had before thanks to the 
    addition of cream cheese along with the sour cream. Serve over hot, 
    buttered flat noodles.
